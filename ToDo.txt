Issues:
have ordering by drag and drop
Have add button in section when editing


add auth check in all admin activities
secure db rules in firebase console
have image edit text to input raw value

Next release
The video doesnâ€™t have preference to start from the last seen session, it starts from the beginning.
    I will check regarding efforts for this.
Edit categories has extra padding for buttons at bottom and right

The problem is the person if he has completed his/her certification exams may give the login to others and without cost they will start using the same account. This will not be a advantageous situation for us, hence need to have an alternate or only mobile otp verification. Kindly suggest if you think any other strategy would help.
video ids are generated same for many videos
Look into having OTP on login
Explanation is cut off if too long
have user refresh local copy by online copy by flag
